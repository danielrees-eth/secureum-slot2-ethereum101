Markdown notes for the Secureum security bootcamp, week 2, [solidity-101](https://secureum.substack.com/p/solidity-101)

### 1. Solidity 101

Soldity is a high-level language for implementing smart contracts on Ethereum and other EVM blockchains. It was founded in 2014 by Gavin Wood and developed by Christian Reitwiessner, Alex Beregszazi, and others

### 2. Solidity influences

Solidity was influenced by C++ (OOP & Syntax), Python (modifiers, multiple inheritance, C3 linearization, & super keywords), and JavaScript (function level scoping & `var` keyword). Javascript influences have been reduced since `v0.4.0`

### 3. General features

Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries, and complex user-defined types. It is a fully-featured high level language.
